nytimes-test-app
================

###Simple app to be a study of javascript frameworks/libraries and UI/UX. 
The intended functionality at the moment is:
- Enter a search term and load a list of articles from the NY Times article API.
- Infinite scolling.
- Save an article (in memory for now).
- Display meta info about the article.

###Prototype
This is the plain jQuery prototype that was built to quickly show functionality.

###Backbone
This is the Backbone.js version of Prototype.
